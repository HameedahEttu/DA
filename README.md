    <h3>More About Dora</h3>
	<p>She was appointed by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo as a Director-General for the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).</p>
	<p>At the time, over 60% of drugs in Nigeria were believed to be fake, made in China, India and factories in the southern parts of Nigeria. She reportedly lost a sister to this epidemic. As the new NAFDAC DG, she declared war on these false drugs.</p>
	<p>Her fierce determination to remove all fake drugs from the country earned the nickname "Iron Lady". It also endangered her life. Two assassination attempts were made on her life in 2004. Her hard work paid off as the fake drug market saw a 90% decline.</p>
	<p>After her time at NAFDAC, she was appointed as the federal minister of information and communication between 2008â€“2010. She later ran for election in 2011 as Senator for Anambra Central for the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Two years later, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She became seriously ill. Her last public appearance was in 2014 when a frail-looking Dora was seen at the National Conference in Abuja.</p>
